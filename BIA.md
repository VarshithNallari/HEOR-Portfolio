## 2) Budget Impact Analysis (Excel) - Teprotumumab to Treat Thyroid Eye Disease (TED)

This budget impact analysis evaluates the expected budgetary impact of adopting teprotumumab for eligible patients with thyroid eye disease over a 5-year time horizon from a healthcare payer perspective

### Epidemiology and Target Population

![Epidemiology and target population cascade](budget-impact-analysis/Epidemiology_Teprotumamb.png)

*Target population estimation for active moderate–severe TED in the UK, using an epidemiology cascade (population → Graves’ disease → TED prevalence → severity → eligibility), with prevalent and incident patients reported.*

### Budget Impact Results

#### Total Budget Impact

![Budget impact results — total](budget-impact-analysis/BIA_Results_Total.png)

*Annual total costs are shown for the “world with” vs “world without” teprotumumab, alongside the incremental budget impact. This summarises affordability at the payer level over the 5-year horizon.*

#### Market Share and Uptake Assumptions

![5-year market share and uptake](budget-impact-analysis/BIA_Market_Share_Uptake.png)

*Assumed uptake of teprotumumab over five years and displacement of existing treatment options. Uptake assumptions are a key driver of the budget impact trajectory.*

#### Cost Drivers (Per Patient)

![Cost breakdown per patient](budget-impact-analysis/BIA_Cost_Breakdown_Per_Patient.png)

*Per-patient cost drivers (drug acquisition, administration, adverse events) illustrating that drug acquisition cost is the primary contributor to incremental budget impact.*
